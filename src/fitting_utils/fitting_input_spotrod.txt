### INPUT FILES

# Critical inputs
time_file =  ../nu2_Lupi_c_time.pickle # a path that points to a pickled numpy array of times.
flux_file =	 ../nu2_Lupi_c_norm_fluxes_R100_lw.pickle #  a path that points to a pickled numpy array of fluxes. If this is for a white light curve it should have shape (1,). Otherwise for wavelength-binned fits, it should have shape = (nbins,nfluxes)
error_file = ../nu2_Lupi_c_norm_errors_R100_lw.pickle #  a path that points to a pickled numpy array of fluxes. If this is for a white light curve it should have shape (1,). Otherwise for wavelength-binned fits, it should have shape = (nbins,nfluxes)

# Ancillary inputs for detrending
model_input_files = ../nu2_Lupi_c_time.pickle # paths that point to an arbitrary number of pickled arrays of detrending inputs. Each path needs to be separated by a comma, e.g.: "time.pickle,background.pickle,x.pickle,..."

nthreads = 	2	# number of threads. NOTE: sometimes multi-threading conks out.
prod_only = 0   # do you want to run a single MCMC run all the way through (1) or break this up into an initial chain, followed by a 'production' chain (0). The latter is the default and is necessary if not using a GP so that the photometric uncertainties can be rescaled
