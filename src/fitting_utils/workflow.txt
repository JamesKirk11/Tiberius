The workflow for fitting light curves generated through the reduction_utils process.

This broadly follows the following main steps:

1) edit mcmc_input.dat
2) generate limb darkening coefficients with generate_LDCS.py
3) fit light white curve
4) repeat for spectroscopic light curves, but holding time of mid-transit (t0), the inclination (i) of the planet's transit, and the ratio of the semi-major axis to stellar radius (a/R*) to results from white light curve fit
5) iterate through various systematics models (and possibly wavelength bins) to obtain the most precise transmission spectrum
6) if desired, can experiment with parametric model fitting (pm_fit.py) and GP + parametric model fitting (gppm_fit.py) in addition to standard GP fitting (gp_fit.py)

NOTE:
1) in my experience, I find the best fitting workflow is to run a GP fit with all ancillary data (fwhm, xpos, ypos, am, sky) and then a second iteration with these + time. I then compare the different uncertainties and goodness of fits to see whether time is necessary for each night's data.
