A basic workflow for fitting light curves generated through the reduction_utils process.

This broadly follows the following main steps:

1) edit fitting_input.txt
2) generate limb darkening coefficients with generate_LDCS.py
3) fit light white curve
4) repeat for spectroscopic light curves, but holding time of mid-transit (t0), the inclination (i) of the planet's transit, and the ratio of the semi-major axis to stellar radius (a/R*) to results from white light curve fit
5) iterate through various systematics models (polynomials/GPs) (and possibly wavelength bins) via running run_gppm_fit.py

NOTE:
1) in my experience, I find the best fitting workflow is to run a GP/polynomial fit with all ancillary data (fwhm, xpos, ypos, am, sky) and then a second iteration with these + time. I then compare the different uncertainties and goodness of fits to see whether time is necessary for each night's data.
