# Based on Tiberius input files

### Input files
# paths that point to pickled numpy arrays of time, flux(es) and their errors! 
# Note that the flux file should be a clean transit light curve with all systematics models removed!

time_file = ../F322W2_time.pickle 
flux_file =	../HD209b_F322W2_light_curves_without_polynom.pickle

### System parameters
# here we assume that all system parameters are fixed

period =	  3.52474859	    # the orbital period of the planet in days.
inclination = 86.7190637993871        # the inclination of the planet's orbit in degrees. 
aRs =   	  8.832244590518414	        # the a/Rs of the system. 
ecc =         0.          # eccentricity of the system.
omega =       90           # argument of periastron of the system.
t0 =	      59893.139378	# the time of mid transit in days. Can be fitted for (see further down).
k =           0.12095          # Rp/Rs, this is always fitted for (see further down).

first_integration = 0       # this allows you to clip the first N integrations from your light curves. This uses Python indexing.
last_integration = -1       # this allows you to clip the last N integrations from your light curves. This uses Python indexing.



### Limb-darkening, including whether we want priors and the parameters of the host star

## If you want to use pre-defined limb-darkening parameters (recommended)
# this can be e.g. fitted limb-darkening from the transmission spectrum run or just the generated limb-darkening parameters
# has to be of format wave_centre,wave_fullwidth,u1,u1_err,u2,u2_err,u3,u3_err,u4,u4_err
use_ld_file = ../LD_coefficients_F322W2_exotic.txt 

## If you want to use generate_LDCS.py from Tiberius, you'll need to define the parameters below
# wvls have to be either a single number (in case of white light curve) OR a pickled numpy array of wavlength bin centres
# Note that this is the bin width is FULL WIDTH of the bin NOT the width/2.
wvl_centres = 
wvl_bin_full_width = 

# stellar parameters for limb-darkening generating codes
# Teff = 	6112	       # Stellar effective temperature in K
# Teff_err = 	6         # Error in stellar effective temperature, in K
# logg_star = 4.300      # log(g) of star
# logg_star_err = 0.015  # error in  log(g) of star
# FeH = 	0.305          # Fe/H of star
# FeH_err = 	0.003       # error in Fe/H of star

### Nested sampling parameters

nLive_pdim = 100              # will be multiplied by the number of parameters, so the 'real' live points = nLive_pdim * nDims
precision_criterion = 1e-3    # ratio between prior and posterior space where the nested sampling 'converged'



###  Other parameters, needed for plotting

# rp = 1.66	# planet's radius in Jupiter radii
# rs = 1.62	# star's radius in solar radii
# logg =  # logg of the planet OR can define:
# g = 7.2 # surface gravity of planet (in m/s^2)
# Teq = 1600 # equilibrium temperature of planet in K
