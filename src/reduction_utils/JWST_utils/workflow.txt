1. Download the data

Go to https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html

2. Install the STScI jwst pipeline within a new conda environment called "JWST"

Follow the jwst installation guidelines at https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

3. Run custom_strun on the uncal.fits JWST data files after first editing them so that they point to the correct path location on your file system

$ . /path/to/custom_strun_no_sat_override [file-name-before-the-_uncal.fits-suffix]

Notes:
1) if there is saturation within the images then you will need to look into the custom_strun script that includes prescriptions for overriding the saturation step.
2) if you are working with MIRI data then you will need to run custom_strun_MIRI


4. Run expand_JWST_fits.py to convert jwst .fits files into Tiberius-readable files
