Installation
------------

I am working on making Tiberius pip installable from pypi.

In the meantime, if you use conda environments, I recommend first making a new conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   (.venv) $ conda create -n Tiberius python=3.8

and then download the repository from GitHub. Navigate to the Tiberius directory and within a terminal do:

.. code-block:: bash

   (.venv) $ pip install -e .


Extracting spectra
----------------

Check out the instrument-dependent examples (coming soon, in the meantime see the README, workflows and example notebooks in reduction_utils/).

Fitting light curves
----------------

Check out the examples (coming soon, in the meantime see the README, workflows and example notebooks in fitting_utils/).
