Welcome to Tiberius' documentation!
===================================

**Tiberius** is a Python library for reducing time series spectra and fitting exoplanet transit light curves. This can be used to extract spectra from JWST (all 4 instruments), along with ground-based long-slit spectrographs and Keck/NIRSPEC echelle spectra (beta).

The light curve fitting routines can be used as as standalone to fit, for example, HST light curves extracted with other methods.
