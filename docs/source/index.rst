Welcome to Tiberius' documentation!
===================================

**Tiberius** is a Python library for reducing time series spectra and fitting exoplanet transit light curves. This can be used to extract spectra from JWST (all 4 instruments), along with ground-based long-slit spectrographs and Keck/NIRSPEC echelle spectra (beta).

The light curve fitting routines can be used as as standalone to fit, for example, HST light curves extracted with other methods.

   This project is under active development.
